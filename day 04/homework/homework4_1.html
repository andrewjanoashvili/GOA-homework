    <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus),
        <p> also known as the cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/ KAY-vee),</p>
        <p> is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia,</p>
        <p> family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the name "cavy" for the animal,</p>
        <p> but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts.</p>
        <p>[1] Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea,</p>
        <p> nor are they closely related to pigs. Instead, </p>
        <p>they originated in the Andes region of South America, </p>
        <p>where wild guinea pigs can still be found today.</p>
        <p>[2] Studies based on biochemistry and DNA hybridization suggest </p>
        <p>they are domesticated animals that do not exist naturally in the wild,</p>
        <p> but are descendants of a closely related cavy species such as C.</p>
        <p> tschudii.[3][4] Originally, they were domesticated as livestock </p>
        <p>(source of meat) in the Andean region and are still consumed in some parts of the world.[5]</p>
